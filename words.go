 ** Experiment: words.go
 ** Write a function to count the frequency of words in a string of text and return a map of words with their counts. The function should convert
 ** the text to lowercase, and punctuation should be trimmed from words. The strings package contains several helpful functions for this task,
 ** including Fields, ToLower, and Trim.
 **
 ** Use your function to count the frequency of words in the following passage and then display the count for any word that occurs more than once.

 ** As far as eye could reach he saw nothing but the stems of the great plants about him receding in the violet shade, and far overhead the multiple
 ** transparency of huge leaves filtering the sunshine to the solemn splendour of twilight in which he walked. Whenever he felt able he ran again;
 ** the ground continued soft and springy, covered with the same resilient weed which was the first thing his hands had touched in Malacandra. Once
 ** or twice a small red creature scuttled across his path, but otherwise there seemed to be no life stirring in the wood; nothing to fearâ€”except the
 ** fact of wandering unprovisioned and alone in a forest of unknown vegetation thousands or millions of miles beyond the reach or knowledge of man.

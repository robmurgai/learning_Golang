// Our first sort! This is often the easiest to conceptualize and a natural way for the brain to think about sorting so it's
// typical to do bubble sort first. It's also amongst the least efficient in terms of worst case scenario.

// In bubble sort, we're going to loop through the array and compare each index with the index next to it. If the those two
// numbers are out of order (the lesser index's value is greater than the greater index's value) we swap those two numbers'
// places in the array. We keep looping over that array until everything is in place and nothing was swapped during the last
// iteration.

// What's the Big O on this? Well, there's an inner loop to check to see if indexes need to be swapped, and an outer loop
// that's just checking to see if anything was swapped. That would be make it O(nÂ²). Not efficient, but a great learning tool.
// You'll never use bubble sort for anything serious.

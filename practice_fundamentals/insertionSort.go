// Insertion sort is a step more complex but a bit more useful than bubble sort and is occasionally useful. The worst case
// scenario for it is similar to bubble sort's but its best case makes it suited for times when you're pretty sure a list ////
// almost sorted or likely already sorted.

// We're going to start at the beginning of the list and assume we have a sorted list of length 1 where the first element is
// only sorted element. We're then going to grab the second element, and insert it into the correct spot in our sorted list, //
// either the 0 index or the 1 index, depending if it's smaller or larger than our first element. We now have a sorted list of /// length 2. We then continue on down the line, inserting elements in our sorted side of the list as the unsorted side dwindles.

// What's the Big O? There's an inner loop that goes over your sorted list to find the correct place to insert your item, and
// an outer loop to go over all the numbers. Two loops means O(nÂ²). However since if your list is sorted or nearly so, it can /
// be O(n) in a best case scenario and thus well adapted to that scenario.

// Practice using goroutines and mutexes
// A GRID TO ROVE ON
// Make a grid that the rover can drive around on by implementing a MarsGrid type. Youâ€™ll need to use a mutex to make it safe for use by multiple
// goroutines at once. It should look something like the following:

	"image"
	"log"
	"sync"
)

// of Mars. It may be used concurrently by different
// goroutines.
